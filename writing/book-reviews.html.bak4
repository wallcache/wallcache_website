                    <p class="book-review">
                        Ishiguro's masterpiece is a devastating portrait of emotional repression and wasted
                        opportunities. Narrated by Stevens, an English butler whose unwavering devotion to
                        duty has cost him love and authentic human connection, the novel unfolds through
                        increasingly unreliable recollections.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-review">
                        What makes this extraordinary is how Ishiguro mirrors form and content—Stevens's
                        meticulously controlled prose is the linguistic equivalent of his emotional constraint.
                        The gaps, hesitations, and euphemisms reveal more than direct statements ever could.

                    <p class="book-review">
                        Tara Westover's memoir chronicles her journey from a survivalist family in rural Idaho
                        to earning a PhD from Cambridge. Raised without formal education, Westover's path required
                        not just intellectual growth but painful reconstruction of her entire worldview.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-review">
                        The book's power lies in Westover's honesty about the complexity of leaving behind family.
                        Education transformed her, but at tremendous cost. She resists easy narratives, acknowledging
                        both the abuse and the genuine love that existed.

                    <p class="book-review">
                        Another Ishiguro masterpiece. This dystopian novel follows students at an English boarding
                        school who gradually discover they're clones raised to donate organs. What could be sensational
                        becomes, in Ishiguro's hands, a profound meditation on mortality and identity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-review">
                        The genius lies in restraint. The horror isn't dramatized but accepted with quiet resignation.
                        The characters' passive acceptance mirrors our own relationship with mortality—we know death is
                        coming, yet we focus on smaller concerns.

                    <p class="book-author">Yuval Noah Harari</p>
                    <div class="book-rating">★★★★☆</div>
                    <p class="book-review">
                        Harari's ambitious sweep through human history identifies three major revolutions: Cognitive,
                        Agricultural, and Scientific. His central thesis: humans conquered the world through our unique
                        ability to believe in shared fictions—nations, religions, corporations, money.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-review">
                        The book excels at reframing familiar history. Harari argues the Agricultural Revolution was
                        "history's biggest fraud." However, breadth comes at the expense of depth. Some arguments feel
                        oversimplified, and speculation is occasionally presented as fact.

                    <div class="book-rating">★★★★★</div>
                    <p class="book-review">
                        McCarthy's brutal masterpiece follows a teenage runaway who joins a gang of scalp hunters
                        in 1850s Mexico. The violence is unrelenting, biblical in scale, rendered in prose that
                        oscillates between stark minimalism and baroque grandeur.
                    </p>
                    <p class="book-review">
                        At the novel's dark heart is Judge Holden—one of literature's most terrifying creations.
                        The Judge represents violence as fundamental to human existence, a philosophy the novel
                        neither endorses nor refutes. McCarthy presents evil without explanation or redemption.
