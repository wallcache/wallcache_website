                </h2>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    After three years in data engineering, I've learned that robust pipelines aren't built
                    through clever code—they're built through disciplined processes, comprehensive testing,
                    and respect for Murphy's Law. Every production pipeline will eventually fail. The question
                    isn't if, but when, and how gracefully you've prepared for that moment.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    This covers the practices that have saved me countless midnight debugging sessions:
                    idempotent operations, comprehensive logging, circuit breakers, and the mindset shift
                    from "making it work" to "making it resilient."

                </h2>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    There's a tendency in tech to dismiss literature as impractical—nice, perhaps, but
                    ultimately separate from the "real work" of building systems and shipping products.
                    I think this misses something fundamental about what makes great engineers.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    Literature teaches empathy, ambiguity, and the messy complexity of human systems—exactly
                    what you need when designing products for actual people. The best engineers I know
                    understand that technical problems are rarely purely technical. Great novels are case
                    studies in human complexity.

                </h2>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    The modern data stack has exploded with options. After working with various tools over
                    the past few years, here's what I've settled on: Python for transformations, dbt for
                    modeling, Airflow for orchestration, and Postgres for storage.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    This isn't a "one true stack" manifesto—context matters enormously. But these tools
                    have proven reliable, maintainable, and flexible. When choosing tools for production
                    systems, boring and reliable beats exciting and new every time.

                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    Long Form Press started as a weekend project—an excuse to learn e-commerce while building
                    something I genuinely wanted to exist. wallcache emerged from wanting to improve my
                    photography skills. Neither was planned as a "business" in the traditional sense.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-excerpt">
                    I've come to see side projects as essential creative practice. The best ones emerge from
                    genuine curiosity and the desire to build something you'd use yourself. Success isn't
                    measured in revenue or users—it's measured in learning, growth, and the satisfaction of
                    making something real.
