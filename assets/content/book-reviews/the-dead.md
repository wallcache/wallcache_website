Joyce's final Dubliners story is his greatest short fiction—a perfect crystallization of paralysis, epiphany, and mortality.

Gabriel Conroy attends a holiday party, gives a speech, desires his wife, then learns she's thinking of a boy who died for love of her. The story builds from social comedy to devastating revelation.

The final pages are some of the most beautiful in English prose. Gabriel's realization about mortality and the past moves from his personal situation to universal truth. The snow falling "upon all the living and the dead" is one of literature's perfect endings.

Joyce shows Dublin's deadening effect through accumulating details—petty conversations, social performances, paralyzed lives. Then he opens it to cosmic scale without breaking the realistic frame.

At 16,000 words, it's Joyce's longest story but feels perfectly compressed. Every detail matters.

The bridge between the realist Joyce of Dubliners and the experimental Joyce of Ulysses. Absolute masterpiece.
