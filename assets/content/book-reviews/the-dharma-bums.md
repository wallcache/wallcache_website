Kerouac's follow-up to On the Road trades speed for contemplation. Where the earlier book races across America in cars, this one climbs mountains and sits zazen. The beat aesthetic meets Buddhism.

Japhy Ryder (based on Gary Snyder) represents everything Kerouac aspires to—disciplined meditation practice combined with spontaneous joy. The contrast between Kerouac's alcoholic chaos and Japhy's studied simplicity creates the book's tension.

The mountain climbing sections are genuinely beautiful. Kerouac captures the physical exhaustion and spiritual clarity of high altitude with impressive precision. These passages justify the book's reputation.

But there's something performative about the Buddhism—Kerouac wants enlightenment without the work. The book acknowledges this contradiction without fully confronting it.

Lighter than Kerouac's best work, but still worth reading for the mountain scenes and its influence on 1960s counterculture.
