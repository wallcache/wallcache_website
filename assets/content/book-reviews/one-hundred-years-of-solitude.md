García Márquez's masterpiece invented magical realism as we know it—the seamless blend of the miraculous and the mundane where a woman ascends to heaven while folding sheets and it's treated as just another Tuesday.

The Buendía family's multi-generational saga mirrors Latin American history—colonization, civil war, modernization, decay. But García Márquez tells it as myth, not documentary. History becomes legend becomes history again.

The recurring names (José Arcadio, Aureliano) could be confusing but are actually the point. The family repeats itself, makes the same mistakes, can't escape its patterns. This is what the novel says about Latin America, about all of us.

The prose is lush, sensual, dreamlike. García Márquez writes with absolute confidence—ghosts appear, women give birth to children with pig tails, and the narrative never pauses to explain or justify.

Ending is devastating—not sad, exactly, but final in a way few novels achieve. Required reading.
