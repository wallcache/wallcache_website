Hemingway's late novella is his most stripped-down work—just an old fisherman, a giant marlin, and the sea. The prose is elemental, almost biblical.

Santiago's three-day struggle with the marlin becomes a meditation on endurance, dignity, and defeat. He catches the fish, sharks devour it, he returns with only a skeleton. But the struggle itself holds meaning.

Hemingway's code of grace under pressure finds its purest expression here. Santiago doesn't complain, doesn't explain, just endures. The stoicism could feel hollow but somehow doesn't.

The symbolism is obvious (Christ imagery, lions in dreams) but Hemingway earns it through the physical detail of fishing. This isn't abstract allegory—Santiago's hands crack and bleed.

Short enough to read in an afternoon, but it lingers. Hemingway's last great work before the decline.

Perfect minor masterpiece.
