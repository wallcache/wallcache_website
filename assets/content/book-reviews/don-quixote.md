The first modern novel, and in many ways still the best. Cervantes created the template: self-aware, playful, deeply human, formally inventive. Everything that came after is in conversation with this book.

Don Quixote's delusion—that he's a knight-errant in an age of merchants—is both absurd and noble. Cervantes never quite decides whether we should laugh at him or admire him. The genius is maintaining that ambiguity across 900 pages.

Sancho Panza's relationship with Quixote is one of literature's great friendships. He knows his master is mad, joins him anyway, gradually absorbs some of his idealism. By the end, Sancho is the one who doesn't want the adventure to stop.

The book is funnier than you expect—genuinely comic, not just historically important comedy. But it's also melancholic, especially in the second volume when Quixote and Sancho meet people who've read about their adventures. The layers of meta-fiction are dizzying.

Long, occasionally meandering, but never dull. The foundation of the modern novel for good reason.
