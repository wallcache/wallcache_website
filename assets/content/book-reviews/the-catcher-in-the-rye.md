Salinger's novel remains definitive for adolescent alienation—Holden Caulfield's voice still resonates despite decades of imitation and parody.

The book's genius is its voice. Holden's colloquial, rambling narration feels completely authentic—the way a smart, damaged teenager actually talks and thinks. The "phoniness" obsession captures something real about adolescent idealism.

But there's more here than teenage angst. Holden's breakdown is clearly related to his brother Allie's death, though he can't directly confront this. The novel shows trauma's indirect effects brilliantly.

The ending is deliberately ambiguous—is Holden in a mental hospital? Has anything changed? Salinger refuses easy resolution.

The controversy (banned books lists, would-be censors) seems almost quaint now. The book is gentle, even sweet. Holden's anger masks profound tenderness.

Doesn't feel as shocking as it once did, but the voice remains perfect. Essential reading.
