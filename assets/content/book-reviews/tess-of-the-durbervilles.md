Hardy's most devastating novel is a sustained argument against the moral framework of Victorian England. Tess is destroyed not by her own choices but by the society that judges her.

The subtitle—"A Pure Woman"—is Hardy's direct challenge to conventional morality. Tess is raped (though Hardy couldn't explicitly say so), abandoned, shamed. Victorian readers would call her fallen; Hardy insists she remains pure.

What makes this more than a thesis novel is Hardy's formal brilliance. The agricultural calendar structures the narrative—planting, harvest, winter, renewal. Tess moves through landscapes that mirror her inner states.

The ending is almost unbearably tragic. Hardy arranges the final sequences at Stonehenge with perfect symbolic weight. Tess becomes a sacrificial victim, destroyed by ancient patterns of oppression.

Not subtle, but intentionally so. Hardy's rage at injustice powers every page. Essential Victorian fiction.
