Where War and Peace explores history and philosophy, Anna Karenina focuses relentlessly on the question: how should we live? Tolstoy presents two paths—Anna's passionate but destructive affair, and Levin's search for meaningful work and family life.

Anna's tragedy isn't that she loves Vronsky, but that society's moral framework offers no room for her authentic self. Tolstoy shows enormous sympathy for her predicament while also acknowledging the real damage caused by her choices. The novel refuses easy answers.

Levin's parallel story—often overlooked—is equally compelling. His struggles with faith, his attempts to find purpose in agricultural reform, his awkward courtship of Kitty—these sections are among the most psychologically acute in all literature.

Tolstoy's famous opening line about unhappy families proves true in the execution. Each character's misery is specific, earned, devastating. The final train station scene is one of literature's most perfectly constructed moments of tragedy.

Dense, morally complex, formally perfect. Tolstoy at his absolute best.
