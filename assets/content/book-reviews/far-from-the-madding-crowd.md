Hardy's fourth novel showcases his greatest strengths: complex female characters, agricultural detail, and the sense that human plans always founder against larger forces.

Bathsheba Everdene is one of Victorian literature's most interesting heroines—vain, independent, impulsive, intelligent. Hardy doesn't simplify her. She makes terrible choices and must live with consequences, but she's never reduced to a moral lesson.

The three suitors (steady Gabriel, passionate Troy, obsessive Boldwood) represent different masculinities, different relationships to land and labor. Hardy uses them to explore what sustains vs. what destroys.

The agricultural descriptions are extraordinary—sheep shearing, harvest, storm. Hardy grew up farming and it shows. These aren't decorative backgrounds but the novel's moral center. Those who understand the land (Gabriel) endure; those who don't (Troy) destroy.

Less bleak than Hardy's later novels, but just as formally perfect. Underrated masterpiece.
