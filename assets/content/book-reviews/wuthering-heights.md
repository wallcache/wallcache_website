Brontë's only novel is a Gothic masterpiece of obsessive love and generational trauma. Heathcliff and Catherine's relationship destroys everyone around them, yet Brontë makes their passion feel inevitable, almost cosmic.

The narrative structure is brilliant—multiple narrators, flashbacks within flashbacks, stories nested like Russian dolls. You're always at a remove from the central events, hearing them secondhand, which somehow intensifies them.

Heathcliff is one of literature's most complex villains. Brontë gives him clear motivation (class humiliation, Catherine's betrayal) but doesn't excuse the cruelty. He's victim and abuser, romantic hero and domestic tyrant.

The Yorkshire moors aren't just setting—they're a character, wild and indifferent. The human dramas play out against landscapes that dwarf human concerns.

The ending suggests regeneration (Hareton and young Catherine) but it feels tenuous. The novel's dark vision has more power than its hopeful conclusion.

Savage, weird, formally perfect. English literature's greatest Gothic novel.
