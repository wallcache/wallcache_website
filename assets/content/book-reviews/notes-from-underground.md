Dostoevsky's novella invented the modern anti-hero—the Underground Man is bitter, contradictory, self-aware enough to hate himself but not change.

Part One is pure philosophy—a sustained attack on rationalism, utopianism, and the idea that humans act in their self-interest. The Underground Man argues we choose suffering to prove we're free.

Part Two dramatizes this through humiliating personal episodes. The Underground Man crashes a party, insults everyone, propositions a prostitute, then morally lectures her. He's awful, yet Dostoevsky makes him compelling.

The book's psychology is unnervingly accurate. The Underground Man's spirals of self-justification, his need to feel superior while knowing he's pathetic—this is how self-deception actually works.

This is the foundation for modernist alienation, existentialism, and basically all 20th-century literature about consciousness turned against itself.

Short, dense, brilliant. Essential Dostoevsky.
