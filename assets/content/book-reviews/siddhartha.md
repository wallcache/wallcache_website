Hesse's spiritual fable follows a young man's search for enlightenment in ancient India. Siddhartha rejects his Brahmin upbringing, spends years with ascetics, becomes a wealthy merchant, finally finds peace as a ferryman.

The book's strength is its structure—Siddhartha must experience everything (pleasure, asceticism, wealth, poverty) before understanding that wisdom can't be taught, only lived. Each phase of his journey feels necessary.

Hesse writes with beautiful simplicity. The prose has an almost biblical quality—clear, measured, deceptively deep. The river sections especially have genuine poetic power.

But it can feel didactic. The lessons are stated rather obviously. Where great spiritual literature (Tolstoy, Dostoevsky) shows religious experience through character and conflict, Hesse sometimes just explains it.

Still, for a short, accessible introduction to Eastern philosophy, it's hard to beat. Many people encounter Buddhism first through this book for good reason.
