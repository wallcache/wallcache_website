The defining Beat Generation novel—spontaneous prose attempting to capture the rhythm of American restlessness. Kerouac and Dean Moriarty (Neal Cassady) drive back and forth across America searching for... something. Kicks, meaning, authentic experience.

The prose style is the point. Kerouac typed this on a single scroll of paper in three weeks, trying to capture thought at the speed of consciousness. Sometimes it works brilliantly—the language has genuine momentum, energy.

But the philosophy is adolescent. The constant movement, the jazz clubs, the drugs—it's all presented as liberation, but reads increasingly as aimless male privilege. The treatment of women is particularly dated.

What saves it is Kerouac's ear for American speech and his genuine love of the country's vastness. The descriptions of landscape, the snapshot portraits of minor characters—these moments transcend the book's limitations.

Historically important, occasionally beautiful, ultimately exhausting. Worth reading once.
