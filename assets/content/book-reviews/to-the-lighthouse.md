Woolf's modernist masterpiece uses stream-of-consciousness to capture how we actually experience time and memory. The novel's three sections span a decade but feel both compressed and expanded.

Mrs. Ramsay dominates the first section through her presence; the second section ("Time Passes") records her absence. Woolf shows how a personality can structure reality even after death.

The technique is what matters—Woolf moves fluidly between minds, capturing the gap between inner experience and outer expression. What we say vs. what we mean, what we see vs. what we feel.

The lighthouse itself works as pure symbol—longed for, delayed, finally reached. The journey's meaning shifts depending on who undertakes it and when.

Not plot-driven in any conventional sense. The pleasure is in Woolf's sentences, her ability to render consciousness on the page. This is what modernism can do at its best.

Difficult, gorgeous, profound.
