Bulgakov's masterpiece is unlike anything else—Satan visits Soviet Moscow, Pontius Pilate appears in nested narrative, a writer and his lover suffer under Stalin. It's satire, fantasy, historical fiction, love story.

The Satan sections (Woland and his retinue) satirize Soviet bureaucracy with devastating precision. The absurdity of socialist realism, the terror of arbitrary power—Bulgakov captured it while living through it.

The Pilate chapters, initially seeming digressive, actually mirror the Moscow sections. Both show truth crushed by institutional power. Pilate's cowardice parallels the Soviet writers who betrayed art for safety.

Margarita's supernatural revenge on the critics who destroyed her lover is one of literature's great fantasy sequences—comic, violent, cathartic.

Bulgakov wrote this while dying, knowing it couldn't be published in his lifetime. The book is an act of profound courage—art created in defiance of totalitarianism.

Wild, profound, formally daring. Essential 20th-century literature.
