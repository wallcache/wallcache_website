Woolf's biography of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's cocker spaniel is her most accessible work—playful, light, yet still formally interesting.

Telling the story from Flush's perspective allows Woolf to satirize both Victorian society and biographical conventions. The dog notices details humans ignore—smells, textures, hierarchies.

The class commentary is sharp—Flush moves from country freedom to London confinement to Italian liberation. His experience mirrors broader Victorian social structures.

But it's minor Woolf. The experimental technique feels applied rather than necessary. The pleasure is in the wit, not the insight.

Still, there's something charming about Woolf taking a break from modernist intensity to write about a dog. The affection is genuine.

Slight but enjoyable. Not essential Woolf, but worth reading if you've finished the major works.
