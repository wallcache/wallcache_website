Hemingway claimed all American literature comes from this book. Overstatement, maybe, but not by much. Twain created the American vernacular voice, proved that serious literature could be written in actual American speech.

Huck's moral development—choosing to "go to hell" rather than betray Jim—is one of American literature's great moments. Twain shows how official morality (supporting slavery) can be less ethical than "sin" (helping a slave escape).

The satire of American society is devastating—con men, feuds, lynch mobs, religious hypocrisy. Twain exposes it all through Huck's naive-but-perceptive narration.

The ending (Tom Sawyer's elaborate "rescue" scheme) frustrates many readers. But it's thematically perfect—Huck returns to society's games and racism. The freedom of the raft can't last.

The racial language is historically accurate but difficult. Twain's anti-racist purpose is clear, but teaching this requires serious context.

The foundation of American literature. Essential.
