Wilde's only novel is a Gothic fable about aestheticism taken to its logical extreme. Dorian Gray stays young and beautiful while his portrait ages and corrupts, bearing the marks of his sins.

The premise is clever, but the book's real power is in Wilde's dialogue. Lord Henry's epigrams about art, morality, and pleasure are the novel's center. Whether Wilde endorses or satirizes these views remains ambiguous.

The conflict between aesthetic and moral values drives the narrative. Can beauty excuse evil? Should art serve morality? Wilde seems to argue both yes and no, depending on the chapter.

The novel was scandalous in 1890—its hints at homosexuality, its amoral protagonist. Modern readers might find it tame, but its formal daring remains.

The ending feels rushed—Dorian's sudden conscience seems unearned. But the central conceit is perfect, and Wilde's prose sparkles.

Essential Victorian literature, even if it's not quite a masterpiece.
