Murakami's most realistic novel is a departure from his usual surrealism—no talking cats, no alternate dimensions, just young people navigating love and mental illness in 1960s Tokyo.

Watanabe's relationship with the emotionally fragile Naoko and the vibrant Midori creates a straightforward romantic triangle, but Murakami complicates it by linking it to questions of memory, grief, and survival.

The book's treatment of mental illness is surprisingly sophisticated for 1987. Naoko's depression isn't romanticized or easily resolved. The sanatorium sections have real weight.

But there's something adolescent about the philosophy—the idea that some people are too sensitive for this world, that depth equals sadness. It's seductive when you're young, less convincing with age.

The prose is Murakami's usual clean, simple style. It reads quickly, almost dangerously so—the emotional manipulation is effective.

Moving, well-crafted, but ultimately feels less substantial than his weirder work.
