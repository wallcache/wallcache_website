Wilde's final play is a perfect comedy of manners—the form executed so brilliantly it becomes something more than satire.

The plot is pure farce: mistaken identities, invented relatives, improbable revelations. But Wilde uses this structure to satirize Victorian society's obsession with surfaces over substance.

Every line is an epigram. Characters speak in perfectly balanced paradoxes that invert conventional wisdom. "The truth is rarely pure and never simple" isn't just funny—it's philosophically serious.

Lady Bracknell steals every scene—her interrogation of Jack about being found in a handbag is one of English literature's great comic moments. The absurdity is played completely straight.

The genius is Wilde's complete commitment to frivolity. There's no moment of sincerity, no serious moral. The play argues that style is more important than substance, and proves it through its own perfection.

Flawless. The best English comedy of manners.
