Dickens' ghost story invented Christmas as we know it—the modern holiday's emphasis on generosity, family, and redemption comes largely from this novella.

Scrooge's transformation from miser to philanthropist should feel contrived but works through Dickens' commitment to the supernatural elements. The ghosts are genuinely eerie, not just moral devices.

The social criticism is sharp—Dickens uses the Christmas setting to attack industrial capitalism's indifference to poverty. Tiny Tim's condition is directly linked to Scrooge's business practices.

The prose has Dickens' usual energy—comic exaggeration, sentimental appeals, vivid grotesques. He writes at full intensity even in this short form.

The story's massive cultural footprint (countless adaptations, parodies, references) proves its power. Despite familiarity, it still works.

Minor Dickens, but perfectly executed. The essential Christmas story.
