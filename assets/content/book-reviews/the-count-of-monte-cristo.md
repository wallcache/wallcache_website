The greatest revenge story ever written. Dumas takes a simple premise—wronged man escapes prison, acquires fortune, systematically destroys his enemies—and spins it into 1,200 pages of intricate plotting and moral complexity.

Edmond Dantès's transformation from naive sailor to sophisticated count is perfectly calibrated. Dumas shows how suffering and time in the Château d'If don't just harden him—they educate him, reshape him completely. The count is almost a different person, which makes his revenge both satisfying and troubling.

The pleasure is in the plotting. Dumas orchestrates multiple revenge schemes simultaneously, each tailored to the specific crime committed against Dantès. The precision and patience are almost architectural.

But the book is smarter than pure revenge fantasy. As the count executes his plans, Dumas introduces doubt—is this justice or cruelty? The final chapters complicate everything, suggesting revenge might be God's province, not man's.

Pure narrative pleasure, but with real moral weight. The perfect long novel.
